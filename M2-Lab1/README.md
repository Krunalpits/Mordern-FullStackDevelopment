JavaScript Practice Projects:

1. Practice with Functions
Problem Description
Write four functions that perform basic mathematical operations:

halfNumber(): Divide a number by 2 and log the result (e.g., "Half of 5 is 2.5").
squareNumber(): Square a number and log the result (e.g., "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9").
percentOf(): Calculate the percentage the first number represents of the second (e.g., "2 is 50% of 4").
findModulus(): Find the modulus of two numbers (e.g., "2 is the modulus of 4 and 10").


2. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Problem Description
Create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where:
The user chooses rock, paper, or scissors.
The computer randomly selects one of the options.
The winner is determined by the rules:
Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
If there's a tie, the game asks the user to play again.
If the user inputs invalid data, prompt for a valid choice.

How to Run:
Copy the code into a .js file.
Open in a browser or run in Node.js.
